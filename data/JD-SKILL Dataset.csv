The world's largest asset class in fixed income, operates with the worst data.

Technology has revolutionised the equity markets with electronic trading, quant algos and instantaneous news. However, in debt and fixed income, the picture is completely different. Trades are placed over the phone, news is slow, and information is imperfect. Billions of dollars of capital is allocated to companies, projects and investments all over the world - making the best decisions on where to deploy it, requires the best information.

The debt capital markets behave like it’s still the 1980s, it is the last to be technologised - our mission is to make it happen.

Our fast growing list of clients include 9 of the top 10 Investment Banks, leading asset managers, hedge funds and law firms.

What You’ll Work On

Every day is different, but here’s an example of the kind of things you’ll work on:
Development and engineering primarily on the internal and external facing web applications of the 9fin platform.
This can range from directly getting involved in coding and implementation of features, code review and mentoring of junior developers, to involvement in early research and experimentation with new technologies providing input for new features and products
You'll have the ability to move between working on our client facing web application stack, internal web applications and tools for our ML/AI serving & development systems as per your interests and active open projects.
Write code delivering new frontend functionality, consuming API’s, data routing/processing, automation and testing.
Opportunity to take on the technical leadership on projects, defining and designing systems, making quick proof of concepts and working closely with Product and our Clients.
Continually improve on the 9fin codebase, taking the chance to automate, refactor and document when you can.

A note from the hiring manager

At 9fin, our frontend team is composed of a diverse group of individuals who bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table. We celebrate and value diversity, considering it an essential factor for creative problem-solving and innovation.

Currently, our team is tackling some fairly complex issues, but we are confident in our ability to address them. We understand that no one person has all of the answers, which is why we rely on collective knowledge and team effort to find solutions. By working collaboratively and drawing on each other's strengths, we are able to approach challenges from a variety of angles and arrive at the best possible outcome.

A note from the CTO

Great web engineering is noticed and valued at 9fin. It is even in our company values. Our clients are used to clunky legacy enterprise internal systems, which have not changed for decades. But that low bar does not make us strive for the minimum. We have the chance to start with a blank canvas and bring the best ideas in web engineering, UX and design to the table. Our secret?...We use 9fin to build 9fin. Our team uses 9fin just as much as our clients. So gone are the days of rationed access to users and shooting in the dark with little to no feedback. Your future colleagues are always at hand to really collaborate with you, and our client base is also very excited and keen to be involved after years of feeling powerless in the systems they use for work. We will absolutely carve out and protect the time for long and deep thinking/research on new technologies and continuing our expertise in presenting complex data rich applications.

9fin is an equal opportunities employer

Don’t meet every single requirement? At 9fin we are dedicated to building and promoting a fair and inclusive workplace where everyone can flourish, reach their full potential and truly belong. We recognise diverse teams allow a more creative and productive environment. So, if you’re excited about this role but your experience doesn’t perfectly align with the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You might just be who we’re looking for - for this role, or perhaps another.","ReactJS,Typescript,CRA, Vite, Next.js"
